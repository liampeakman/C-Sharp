Console App used to store and borrow movies using complex algorithms including a BST 

### Overview 
In this project you need to develop a software application for solving a real-world problem. In
the development of this software application, you need to use some specified data structures
to store and manipulate some data, and need to apply some algorithms that you have learnt in
the lectures to solve some computational problems in the software application, and analyse
the time complexity of the algorithms. 

### Premable
You are hired to develop a software application for a community library to manage its movie
DVDs.
The community library lends movie DVDs to its members. The information about a movie
includes title, starring, director, duration, genre, classification, and release date. The genre of
a movie may be Drama, Adventure, Family, Action, Sci-Fi, Comedy, Animated, Thriller, or
Other. A movie is classified as General (G), Parental Guidance (PG), Mature (M15+), or
Mature Accompanied (MA15+). The community library may have multiple DVDs of the
same movie.
In order to borrow movie DVDs, members must register with the system through a librarian.
When members are registered with the system, their full name, residential address, and a
contact phone number are recorded in the system. The system also keeps the information
about the movie DVDs that are currently being borrowed by each of the registered members.
When a registered member borrows a movie DVD, the movie DVD is added to the member’s
record; and when the member returns the movie DVD to the community library, the movie
DVD is removed from the member’s record. A registered member can borrow up to 10
movies at any time. However, none can borrow multiple copies of the same movie at the same
time. It is assumed that both the full names of members and the titles of movies are unique.
The system analysis has now been completed, and a high-level object-oriented design has also
been finished. Your task is to follow the following iterative and incremental software
development process to implement the object-oriented design.
